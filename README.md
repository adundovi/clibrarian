CLibrarian
==========

**CLibrarian**, short for the Command-line Librarian, is a command-line tool written in **Python** which consists of interfaces to online library databases such as Google Books, arXiv, INSPIRE-HEP. The implemented set of interfaces is focused on physics, but other services can be added easily. The basic idea is to simplify frequent operations when dealing with references, citations and other library tasks through a coherent set of commands. Using the tool in combination with the GNU/Unix toolchain is highly encouraged.
